### **covidClassifyR**: a fit-for-purpose tool to support COVID-19 sero-surveillance via serological data processing and statistical analysis

This analytical tool was developed to streamline the processing of serological data generated using a validated high-throughput multiplex serological assay for measuring antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (REFS). This tool also aims to make the quality control and interpretation of the raw data generated from this serological assay accessible to all researchers without the need for a specialist background in statistical methods and advanced programming.
